# Designing Our Future

> We do not own the earth. We have borrowed it from our children.

## Who We Are

We are a non-profit organization based in Indianapolis dedicated to accelerating the prioritization of sustainability in all facets of human activity.

## Why We Do

The world is in a mess üí©. This much we can agree upon.

But for most, everything is about to get a lot worse üìâ.

Humanity's growth has exploded üìà, both technologically and in population <LearnMore><PopulationExplosion /></LearnMore> since the Industrial Revolution üè≠. But that We seem to be on a catastrophic trajectory.

## What is the Problem?

It's easy to say the problem is that we have too much carbon in the atmosphere or that we have too many people on this planet. But that's like saying the problem with poverty is not having enough money. It oversimplifies the situation and doesn't provide much direction for a solution.

We think that the problems the world is facing are so incredibly complex that no one can fully explain them, but we're going to try. In fact, many of these problems are still being researched right now, so we will do our best to stay up-to-date.

We're going to provide the most reliable sources we can for all the information we cite on this website, and if you find anything incorrect or out-of-date please let us <LearnMore label="know.">We are working on setting up an email.</LearnMore>

### Part 1: Communication üó£

Many smart people believe that:

- climate change is natural, or
- the impact of humanity is insignficant, or
- it is a myth that has been completely fabricated.

These people are not our enemies.

It's natural, even wise, to question information that is presented to you. In the past few years distrust of mainstream media is at it worst. <LearnMore><TrustInMedia /></LearnMore>

Every person has changed their mind when they were presented with information in the right way.

It is our responsibility to figure out how to communicate it without alienating them or making them feel dumb.

### Part 2: Education üß†

It was known in the 1970s that The

However, the industry took no action to change its business model. From 1988 to
2015, fossil fuel companies doubled their contribution to global warming, producing in 28
years the equivalent of their emissions in the prior 237 years since the Industrial
Revolution. 80 During that time, just 100 companies produced 71 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions

A 2.35 According to one count, the fossil fuel industry spent \$370 million lobbying on
US climate change legislation from 2000 to 2016,

A 3.36 Even today, States subsidize the fossil fuel industry to the tune of \$5.2 trillion per
year, or 6.3 percent of global GDP.85 Another trillion goes to support natural resource
overexploitation. Efficient fossil fuel pricing in 2015 would have reduced global carbon
emissions by 28 percent.

### Part 3: Responsibility üë•

While the most developed countries have produced most of the carbon footprint, it is the least developed countries that will be afflicted.

In the past century the number of people living in extreme poverty has plummeted [source] but this positive trend is going to reverse with climate change.

Just 25 corporate and state components account for 51% of global industrial GHG emissions. And the top 100 account for 71%

However, it is the peoples responsibility to

## Why should you care?

Unless you're expecting to die soon, climate change will affect you and those you care about. If you have children it will affect them much more.

This is not about doing good for others. This is about selfishly preserving your own quality of life.

## What can you do?

1. Spread this message
2. Put pressure on companies and legislators [expand]
3. Reduce your own carbon footprint [expand]
